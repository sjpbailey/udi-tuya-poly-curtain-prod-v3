Steve,

I haven't been to Bend, Oregon for years. Who are you going to see?

Here are the settings for the Smart Bulb-LED SL20. The Amazon listing shows 6 settings, 
but the SmartLife app and Alexa only show 4 and each app gives different values so I am going to make a choice.

temp_value_v2 = 0         (Warm White)
temp_value_v2 = 333     (Soft White)
temp_value_v2 = 667     (Daylight)
temp_value_v2 = 1000  (Cool White)

When I tested these values in the Tuya Debug Device the bulbs would not change temperature. 
I also noticed that the brightness would not change either. However, the on-and-off works flawlessly.


Here are the settings for the air circulator. 
By the way, switch_vertical only works with the remote and SmartLife app and has never worked with Alexa. 
I just tested it with the Tuya Debug Device and it doesn't work there either, however, everything else worked fine. 
It would be nice to get that working but it may be a manufacturing issue out of our control.

Here are the settings for the curtain system. By the way, 
I have tested all of the commands and they all work fine except for stop. 
It actually just pauses for a split second and then resumes the initial command 
but it's not an issue because I've never used the stop command until today.
